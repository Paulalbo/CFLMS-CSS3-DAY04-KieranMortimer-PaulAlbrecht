			<h1>Bob Ross</h1>

			<p>We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents</p>

		<div class="quotes">
			<p>Shwooop. Hehe. You have to make those little noises, or it just doesn't work</p>

			<p>Trees cover up a multitude of sins</p>

			<p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend</p>

			<p>Water's like me. It's laaazy... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>

			<p>Haha, and just beat the devil out of it</p>

			<p>People look at me like I'm a little strange, when I go around talking to squirrels and rabbits and stuff. That's ok. Thaaaat's just ok</p>

			<p>We want happy paintings. Happy paintings. If you want sad things, watch the news</p>

			<p>That's where the crows will sit. But we'll have to put an elevator to put them up there because they can't fly, but they don't know that, so they still try</p>

			<p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow</p>
			
			<p>That'll be our little secret</p>
