			<ul>
				<li>Shwooop. Hehe. You have to make those little noises, or it just doesn't work</li>

				<li>Trees cover up a multitude of sins</li>

				<li>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend</li>

				<li>Water's like me. It's laaazy... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</li>

				<li>Haha, and just beat the devil out of it</li>

				<li>People look at me like I'm a little strange, when I go around talking to squirrels and rabbits and stuff. That's ok. Thaaaat's just ok</li>

				<li>We want happy paintings. Happy paintings. If you want sad things, watch the news</li>

				<li>That's where the crows will sit. But we'll have to put an elevator to put them up there because they can't fly, but they don't know that, so they still try</li>

				<li>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow</li>
				
				<li>That'll be our little secret</li>
